## Limits
- No command blocks longer than 4 minutes; no Bash `timeout` above 240000 ms.
  macOS has no `timeout` program (exit 127): never wrap a command in it;
  bound a job with the recipe below.
  A job that can run longer (a check over end-to-end tests, a cold build,
  load runs; the project's rules name them) starts detached with a log and
  is seen to finish before you reply:

      cd <path> && mkdir -p <logs> && nohup <command> > <logs>/long.log 2>&1 < /dev/null & echo $!
      i=0; while kill -0 <pid> 2>/dev/null && [ $i -lt 230 ]; do sleep 1; i=$((i+1)); done; kill -0 <pid> 2>/dev/null && echo RUNNING || tail -15 <logs>/long.log

  One call per wait; it prints RUNNING or the end of the log. `<logs>` is
  the folder your flow names, else the scratchpad the prompt gives. A
  foreground command that hit the limit was a long one: check it is gone,
  run it detached. Wait on a process by its own pid, never by a
  machine-wide name.
- Start no dev server or preview on a fixed port: another worktree may hold it.
- Leave no process running when you reply, unless your flow says which one.
- Never print a secret: no `set -x`, `bash -x`, `curl -v` or `--trace` on an
  authenticated call, no `env` or `printenv`. If one appears in output, say
  so in your reply and do not repeat it.
- Never `git stash`: the stash is shared by every worktree; set work aside
  with a WIP commit.
- Never search from `/`; search inside your worktree or the paths you are given.
